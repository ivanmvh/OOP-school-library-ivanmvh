# Sneak peek: OOP school library

## Learning objectives
- Use OOP to build a simple app.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that you will create will allow you to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!

### How to build the "OOP school library" app

You will start by building the most essential pieces of the system. To do that, you will practice Object Oriented Programming. To build the app or system you will need to create the entities presented in this diagram. Spoiler alert: this is a UML class diagram that you did not get to know yet  - it is a topic from upcoming lessons. However, it can give you an overall idea of what you are going to build.

Once you have the core part prepared, you will create a simple UI layer which will be a console app interacting with a user. The final result will be similar to the one presented in the following video.

### Projects list

You will be building your "OOP school library" app for more than a week. Here is the list of projects that will guide you through the steps described above. You will find details about each of the project requirements in the upcoming program activities. In some of the projects, you will be working collaboratively by using pair programming.

- Project 1: add Person, Student, and Teacher classes.
- Project 2: use the "Decorator" design pattern.
- Project 3: set up associations.
- Project 4: add basic UI.
- Project 5: refactor your code.
- Project 6: preserve data.
- Project 7: unit tests.
